# Poole

Poole is a web gallery using Sinatra. It was inspired by many of the
static site generators out there, e.g. [Jekyll](http://github.com/)
and [Nesta CMS](https://github.com/ganesan/nestacms).

**It is currently a work in progress and not really usable yet.**

## Goals and features

- Use YAML to describe albums and photos
- Command-line tools for administration and metadata extraction
- Heavy caching
- Authentication through Facebook, Twitter, etc.
